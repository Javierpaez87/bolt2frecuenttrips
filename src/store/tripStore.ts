Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// At the end of the file, add these closing brackets:

}));
```

The issue was that the file was missing the final closing brackets for the `create` function call. The fixed version adds two closing parentheses to properly close:

1. The object literal containing all the store methods
2. The `create()` function call

This matches the opening `create<TripState>((set, get) => ({` at the start of the store definition.

The rest of the file appears structurally sound with properly matched brackets throughout the individual methods. The only issue was at the very end where the store creation wasn't properly closed.
