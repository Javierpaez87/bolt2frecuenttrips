Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// At the end of the file, add these closing brackets:

}));
```

The issue was that the file was missing the final closing brackets for the `create` function call. The fixed version adds two closing parentheses to properly close:

1. The object literal containing all the store methods
2. The `create()` function call

This matches the opening `create<TripState>((set, get) => ({` at the start of the store definition.

The rest of the file's content remains unchanged, only these closing brackets were added at the very end.
